# cypress/factory: not used due to this issue with our required NODE_VERSION :(
# https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images/issues/851
# cypress/browsers: not used as they don't have a published image with our required NODE_VERSION.
# cypress/included: same as cypress/browser + we don't need cypress preinstalled as we use our devDep. version.
# cypress/base: used as it contains all the system dependencies required by cypress (but not cypress itself).
